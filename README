------------------
* Getting Started
------------------
TBD

-----------------
* Dependencies
-----------------
Make sure you install the following external dependencies:
	- VTK
	- OpenSceneGraph
	   - Note for osx 10.7: as of Feb 2012 you need to patch one of the files
		 in order for compilation to complete.  See /doc/osx-osg.txt for details
	- PCL?

-----------------
* Compilation
-----------------
~$ cmake .
~$ make

-----------------
* Contributing!
-----------------
Here are the rules:
	- Read this: http://spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy
	- PLEASE use detailed commit messages.
	- Do NOT put generated files into the repository.  Its easy to recompile.
	  Its hard to track down glitches caused by a committed CMakeCache.txt
	- Use Doxygen style comments on top of public interfaces.
